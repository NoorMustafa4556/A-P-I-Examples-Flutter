# 🌐 Flutter API Course Examples

A collection of **Flutter example projects** demonstrating different techniques for working with **REST APIs**.  
This repository is designed to help developers learn how to **fetch remote data, parse JSON, manage state, and display API responses** in a clean and user-friendly Flutter interface.

---


## ✨ Features

- 📡 **Fetching Data** – Examples of GET requests from public APIs  
- 🔄 **JSON Parsing** – Convert API responses into Dart objects using models  
- 🗂 **State Management** – Update UI dynamically after fetching API data  
- ⚠️ **Error Handling** – (if implemented) graceful handling of network or parsing errors  
- 🏗 **Clean Architecture** – (if present) separation of UI, models, and services for maintainability

🌐 APIs Used
Most examples utilize public free APIs for learning purposes.
A common choice is:

JSONPlaceholder
Example Endpoint:

arduino

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
This API provides fake JSON data for testing and prototyping.
